## Additional Project Information

### Subprojects

- **miniCC**: A lightweight compiler developed by the Hunan University Computer Systems course group. It demonstrates the compilation process from C-like source code to intermediate quadruples, assembly instructions, and final executable format runnable on a custom simulator.

- **bombLab**: An experiment adapted from *CS:APP (Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective)* that focuses on binary analysis, reverse engineering, and debugging skills using tools like GDB or LLDB.
