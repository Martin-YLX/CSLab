## Additional Project Information

### Subprojects

- **miniCC**: A lightweight compiler developed by the Hunan University Computer Systems course group. It demonstrates the compilation process from C-like source code to intermediate quadruples, assembly instructions, and final executable format runnable on a custom simulator.

- **bombLab**: An experiment adapted from *CS:APP (Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective)* that focuses on binary analysis, reverse engineering, and debugging skills using tools like GDB or LLDB.

- **shellLab**: A simplified Unix shell implementation designed as part of the Computer Systems course. This lab covers process creation, job control, and signal handling. Students implement core shell features such as foreground/background job execution, built-in command parsing (quit, jobs, fg, bg), and forwarding of terminal signals (SIGINT, SIGTSTP) to the correct process groups. It reinforces key OS concepts like process groups, signal masks, asynchronous event handling, and concurrent control using system calls like fork, execve, waitpid, and kill.
